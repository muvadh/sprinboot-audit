This project demonstrates a Spring Boot application connected to a MySQL database running in a Docker container. The database is configured via Docker Compose, exposing MySQL on port 3500 with credentials al_user and al_pwd. The Spring Boot application is set up to connect to this MySQL instance for database operations. To get started, simply run docker-compose up -d to launch the MySQL container, then build and run the Spring Boot application. Make sure the database configurations in application.properties match the Docker setup.
